## Description

`useFetchData` is a powerful custom React hook for fetching data from an API. It provides a simple and efficient way to fetch data, handle loading and error states, and cache responses for improved performance.

The hook uses the Fetch API for data fetching and a local cache for storing the fetched data. This reduces the number of network requests and improves the speed and responsiveness of your application.

The `useFetchData` hook also provides `refetch` and `clearCache` functions, giving you full control over when to refetch the data and when to clear the cache. This makes it a flexible and versatile tool for any application that needs to fetch and manage data from an API.

`6pp` is a versatile library that provides custom hooks and components for handling common functionalities in React applications.
